#### TALK ABSTRACT

\
**"Using OWASP Nettacker for Recon and Vulnerability Scanning" by [Sam Stepanyan](https://twitter.com/securestep9)**\
The OWASP Nettacker project was created to automate information gathering, vulnerability scanning, and in general to aid the penetration testing engagements. Nettacker is able to run various scans using a variety of methods and generate scan reports for applications and networks, including services, bugs, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, default credentials and many other cool features - for example the ability to chain different scan methods. This relatively new (Summer 2017) and a lesser-known OWASP project has generated a huge amount of interest at BlackHat Europe 2018/2019 Arsenal live demo gathering massive crowds of seasoned hackers and penetration testers eager to see this new tool in action. This talk will showcase the OWASP Nettacker project giving an overview of its features and including a live demo of the tool.
